# Tasks: Official v1 Release - Production Polish & Complete Authentication

**Input**: Design - [x] T040 [P] Production build configuration optimization in `vite.config.ts`
- [x] T041 [P] Email template customization for Supabase Auth
- [x] T042 [P] Development artifact removal (console.logs, test data, debug features)uments from `/specs/012-official-v1-release/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✅
   → Tech stack: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Mantine UI + Supabase
   → Structure: Single-page web application with service worker
2. Load design documents ✅
   → data-model.md: 7 enhanced models for auth, UI, performance
   → contracts/: 4 contract files for auth, UI, performance, deployment
   → research.md: OAuth integration, UI polish, performance optimization
3. Generate tasks by category ✅
   → Setup: environment configuration, dependencies
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests (TDD)
   → Core: models, services, components
   → Integration: OAuth flows, performance monitoring
   → Polish: production build, deployment, cleanup
4. Apply task rules ✅
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...) ✅
6. Generate dependency graph ✅
7. Create parallel execution examples ✅
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD enforcement)
- Preserve existing functionality while adding enhancements
- Follow constitutional principles: simplicity, testability, no over-engineering
- Commit after each task completion

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Contracts**:
   - auth-contract.md → OAuth integration tests + OAuth implementation
   - ui-contract.md → Theme tests + Premium UI components
   - performance-contract.md → Performance tests + Monitoring implementation
   - deployment-contract.md → Build tests + Production configuration

2. **From Data Model**:
   - 7 enhanced models → 7 parallel model creation tasks (T012-T018)
   - State relationships → Store integration tasks

3. **From User Stories** (quickstart.md):
   - OAuth setup scenario → OAuth integration test + implementation
   - Performance validation → Performance monitoring implementation
   - Production deployment → Build and deployment tasks

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Components → Integration → Deployment
   - Dependencies clearly marked and respected

## Validation Checklist
- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (T005-T008)
- [x] All enhanced models have creation tasks (T012-T018)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (Phase 3.2 before 3.3+)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] TDD ordering enforced (tests fail first)
- [x] Constitutional compliance maintained (simplicity, testability)
