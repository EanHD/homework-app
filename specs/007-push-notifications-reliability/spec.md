# Feature Specification: Push Notifications ‚Äî Reliability v2

**Feature Branch**: `[007-push-notifications-reliability]`  
**Created**: 2025-09-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Push Notifications ‚Äî Reliability v2
Goal: Deliver one (and only one) push per scheduled reminder, even if the app is reopened; ‚ÄúTest notification in ~60s‚Äù works; Android + iOS PWA supported.
Scope:
‚Ä¢ Reuse existing browser subscription (don‚Äôt resubscribe each load).
‚Ä¢ Server: enforce 1 subscription per user (or dedupe at send-time).
‚Ä¢ Cron sender marks sent_at after ‚â•1 successful delivery.
‚Ä¢ schedule endpoint uses UTC ISO, dedupes on retry.
‚Ä¢ CORS + OPTIONS preflight for subscribe/schedule.
‚Ä¢ Settings: working ‚ÄúEnable push‚Äù and ‚ÄúSend test notification‚Äù that schedules + verifies insert.
‚Ä¢ Diagnostics: quick DB queries + console logs.
‚Ä¢ Out of scope: native iOS/Android push (we‚Äôre using Web Push only)."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user who schedules reminders, I receive exactly one push notification per scheduled reminder at the intended time, regardless of whether the app is open, closed, or reopened. A quick ‚ÄúTest notification‚Äù path sends a notification within about one minute to verify that push is working on my device.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given a scheduled reminder for time T, when time T occurs, then exactly one push notification is delivered to the user‚Äôs device and no duplicates are sent.
2. Given the app is closed or subsequently reopened before or after T, when time T occurs, then the user still receives exactly one push notification.
3. Given a user taps ‚ÄúEnable push‚Äù in Settings and grants permission, when they tap ‚ÄúSend test notification‚Äù, then a verification notification is scheduled and arrives within approximately 60 seconds.
4. Given transient network/server retries, when the reminder is due, then at most one notification is ultimately delivered for that reminder.
5. Given a reminder is resubmitted due to client retry, when the system processes the duplicate request, then the reminder results in at most one delivered notification.
6. Given a user uses the app as a PWA on Android or on iOS where Web Push is supported, when reminders are due or tests are sent, then notifications are delivered as above.

### Edge Cases
- If a user revokes notification permission, attempts to send test or scheduled notifications do not deliver; the system surfaces a clear indication to the user on the next relevant action. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: user-facing copy or visual indicator requirements]
- If a user has multiple devices or browsers, clarify whether ‚Äúone push per reminder‚Äù means one per user (single device) or one per active device. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: multi-device delivery policy]
- If the device is offline at time T, delivery occurs when connectivity resumes without creating duplicates.
- If the scheduling payload includes an invalid or ambiguous timestamp, the request is rejected with a clear message. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: allowed tolerance and format guidance for users]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system must deliver exactly one push notification per scheduled reminder occurrence.
- **FR-002**: The system must prevent duplicate deliveries for the same reminder, including when clients retry or the app is reopened.
- **FR-003**: The ‚ÄúTest notification‚Äù action must schedule and deliver a verification notification within approximately 60 seconds under normal conditions. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: success window tolerance and messaging]
- **FR-004**: The experience must work on Android and iOS when using the app as a PWA on devices/browsers that support Web Push.
- **FR-005**: The system must maintain a consistent push target identity per user to avoid redundant deliveries. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: policy for multiple devices/browsers]
- **FR-006**: The system must record successful delivery state so that subsequent retries do not cause additional user-visible notifications.
- **FR-007**: The scheduling interface must accept an unambiguous, standardized timestamp and interpret it consistently across time zones.
- **FR-008**: The scheduling interface must be idempotent so that retried submissions do not create multiple deliveries for the same reminder.
- **FR-009**: The system must allow the client to request notification enablement and provide a clear control to send a test notification from Settings.
- **FR-010**: The system must provide basic diagnostics sufficient for quick verification by developers/operators (e.g., ability to verify that a test reminder was enqueued and delivered, and view minimal logs). [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: exact diagnostic surface and retention]
- **FR-011**: The system must permit requests necessary for enabling push and scheduling reminders from the web client environments in scope. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: origin policies and environments]
- **FR-012**: The system must respect user permission state; if permission is denied, no notification is delivered and the user is informed on next relevant action.
- **FR-013**: Out of scope for this feature: native iOS/Android push channels; only Web Push delivery is included.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: The end user who schedules reminders and receives notifications.
- **Reminder**: A scheduled event representing the intent to notify a user at a specific time.
- **Push Target**: The user‚Äôs current push destination (e.g., an abstraction of the active subscription) used to deliver notifications; exactly one effective target per user to avoid duplicates. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: multi-device handling]
- **Notification Delivery Record**: A record of a delivery attempt and its final outcome, used to ensure single delivery per reminder and for diagnostics.
