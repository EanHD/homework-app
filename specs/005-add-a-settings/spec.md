# Feature Specification: Homework Buddy ‚Äî Settings

**Feature Branch**: `005-add-a-settings`  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Add a Settings section to centralize user preferences with categories for Notifications, Appearance, Data, Onboarding, and About; easily accessible from navigation or overflow; preferences persist locally without accounts; include export/import and clear with Undo; a11y labels and reduced‚Äëmotion respect; deliver page, store updates, and tests.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a student using Homework Buddy, I want a central Settings screen where I can control reminders, appearance, data, onboarding, and app info so the app behaves the way I prefer and I can manage my data safely.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given I open the app, When I navigate to Settings from the sidebar or overflow menu, Then I see grouped sections for Notifications, Appearance, Data, Onboarding, and About.
2. Given reminders are enabled, When I toggle Reminders off in Notifications, Then the app does not schedule or show reminder notifications until I re‚Äëenable them.
3. Given default reminder offset options are shown (10m, 30m, 1h before due), When I select an option, Then the choice is saved and used for future reminder defaults.
4. Given Quiet Hours is off, When I enable Quiet Hours and set a start and end time, Then reminder notifications are suppressed during that window and resume outside it.
5. Given Appearance shows Theme and Font Size, When I toggle Light/Dark and change Font Size (Normal/Large), Then the UI updates immediately and the preference persists after reload.
6. Given I have data, When I tap Export JSON, Then a JSON file containing my classes and assignments is provided for download.
7. Given I have a valid backup file, When I tap Import JSON and confirm, Then the data from the file is merged/restored and a confirmation is shown.
8. Given I want to start over, When I choose Clear All Data and confirm, Then all user data is removed and I can Undo the action within the allowed window.
9. Given I skipped or completed the tour, When I choose Replay First‚ÄëRun Tour, Then the onboarding experience starts again from the beginning.
10. Given I have sample data loaded, When I choose Reset Sample Data, Then existing data is cleared and the default sample data is loaded.
11. Given I open About, When I view the section, Then I see the app name and version with a short credit ‚ÄúMade with ‚ù§Ô∏è by Ean‚Äù.
12. Given I use a screen reader or reduced motion, When I interact with Settings, Then all controls have accessible labels and motion respects the system preference.

### Edge Cases
- Quiet Hours spanning midnight (e.g., 22:00‚Äì07:00) suppresses notifications correctly across days.
- Notification permission denied: toggles remain available but UI indicates permission status; reminders do not display until permission is granted.
- Importing malformed or incompatible JSON results in a clear error and no partial data is applied.
- Clear All Data provides a second confirmation and an Undo option; Undo restores the previous state if used within the defined timeframe.
- Changing default reminder offset affects newly created reminders only; existing explicit reminders are unchanged.
- Theme and font size changes persist locally and apply on subsequent app launches.
- Reduced‚Äëmotion preference disables non‚Äëessential animations/transitions in Settings.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001 (Access)**: Provide a Settings entry that is easy to reach from primary navigation or an overflow menu.
- **FR-002 (Layout)**: Organize Settings into sections: Notifications, Appearance, Data, Onboarding, About.
- **FR-003 (Persistence)**: Persist all Settings locally on the device without requiring sign‚Äëin.
- **FR-004 (Notifications ‚Äì Enable)**: Allow users to enable/disable reminders globally; when disabled, no reminder notifications are shown or scheduled.
- **FR-005 (Notifications ‚Äì Offset)**: Provide a default reminder offset selector with options including 10 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1 hour before due time; the selected value is used for future defaults.
- **FR-006 (Notifications ‚Äì Quiet Hours)**: Provide a Quiet Hours toggle with configurable start and end times that suppress reminder notifications during the window, including windows spanning midnight.
- **FR-007 (Appearance ‚Äì Theme)**: Allow users to toggle Light/Dark theme; the chosen theme applies immediately across the app and persists.
- **FR-008 (Appearance ‚Äì Font Size)**: Allow users to select a font size scale (e.g., Normal, Large); selection applies immediately and persists.
- **FR-009 (Data ‚Äì Export)**: Provide an Export action that outputs a JSON file containing all user data (classes, assignments, and related preferences).
- **FR-010 (Data ‚Äì Import)**: Provide an Import action that accepts a JSON file and restores/merges data; show success or clear error if the file is invalid.
- **FR-011 (Data ‚Äì Clear All)**: Provide a Clear All Data action requiring explicit confirmation; offer an Undo to restore the previous state within a short window.
- **FR-012 (Onboarding ‚Äì Replay)**: Provide a control to replay the first‚Äërun tour from the beginning.
- **FR-013 (Onboarding ‚Äì Sample Data)**: Provide a control to reset sample data (clear current data, then load default sample data).
- **FR-014 (About)**: Display app name and version and the credit text ‚ÄúMade with ‚ù§Ô∏è by Ean‚Äù.
- **FR-015 (Accessibility)**: All controls have descriptive labels, are keyboard accessible, and respect the system reduced‚Äëmotion preference.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Preferences**: Captures user‚Äëspecific settings stored locally.
  - Notifications: `enabled`, `defaultReminderOffset`, `quietHoursEnabled`, `quietStartTime`, `quietEndTime`.
  - Appearance: `theme` (light/dark), `fontScale` (normal/large).
  - Onboarding: `seenOnboarding`, `allowReplay`.
  - Data: n/a (actions only; no long‚Äëterm fields beyond what already exists for data export/import).
  - Metadata (read‚Äëonly): `appName`, `version`, `credit` (display only).

## Ambiguities / [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- Settings entry point: dedicated sidebar tab vs. overflow menu? Prefer sidebar if space allows. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- Default reminder offset set options: fixed (10m/30m/1h) only or include custom minutes? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- Quiet Hours behavior for existing scheduled reminders: cancel vs. delay until window ends? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- Import behavior: merge with existing vs. replace all? Expected conflict resolution? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- Clear All Data Undo window duration and scope (does it include preferences)? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- ‚ÄúReset sample data‚Äù: exact sample content and whether it replaces or adds to current data? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- Theme behavior: add ‚ÄúUse system setting‚Äù option in addition to Light/Dark? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
