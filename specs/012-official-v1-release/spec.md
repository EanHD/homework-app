## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a student, I want to use a professional, fast homework management app that allows me to sign in easily with my existing Google or Apple account, so that I can focus on managing my assignments without technical distractions or delays.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user visits the app, **When** they choose to sign in with Google, **Then** they are redirected to Google OAuth and returned with a working session
2. **Given** a new user visits the app, **When** they choose to sign in with Apple, **Then** they are redirected to Apple OAuth and returned with a working session  
3. **Given** a user requests a magic link, **When** they check their email, **Then** they receive a professional homework-app branded email with clear instructions
4. **Given** a user is using the app, **When** they navigate between pages, **Then** page transitions are smooth and load times are under 1 second
5. **Given** a developer or tester, **When** they access the production app, **Then** they cannot see any development tools, debug information, or testing features
6. **Given** a user accesses the app on mobile, **When** they interact with UI elements, **Then** the interface is polished, consistent, and responds immediately to touch

### Edge Cases
- What happens when OAuth provider is temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system handle slow network connections while maintaining perceived performance?
- What happens if a user has accounts with multiple providers (Google, Apple, email)?
- How does the app behave when accessed from very old browsers or devices?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Authentication & Access
- **FR-001**: System MUST support Google OAuth 2.0 authentication for user sign-in
- **FR-002**: System MUST support Apple Sign-In authentication for user sign-in  
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain existing magic link email authentication
- **FR-004**: Magic link emails MUST use professional homework app branding and clear, student-friendly language
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle account linking when users have multiple authentication methods
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain user sessions securely across authentication providers

#### User Interface & Experience
- **FR-007**: All UI elements MUST have consistent, polished visual design appropriate for students
- **FR-008**: Interface MUST be fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices
- **FR-009**: System MUST hide all development tools, debug information, and testing features in production
- **FR-010**: Navigation between pages MUST feel instant with loading states for any delays over 200ms
- **FR-011**: All interactive elements MUST provide immediate visual feedback on user interaction
- **FR-012**: Color scheme and typography MUST convey professionalism suitable for educational use

#### Performance & Reliability  
- **FR-013**: Initial page load MUST complete within 3 seconds on 3G connections
- **FR-014**: Page transitions MUST complete within 1 second under normal conditions
- **FR-015**: App MUST remain responsive during background data operations
- **FR-016**: System MUST gracefully handle offline scenarios with appropriate user messaging
- **FR-017**: JavaScript bundle size MUST be optimized to minimize download time
- **FR-018**: System MUST implement efficient caching strategies for static assets

#### Content & Messaging

- **FR-020**: Error messages MUST be helpful and actionable for non-technical users  
- **FR-021**: Email communications MUST maintain consistent homework app branding
- **FR-022**: System MUST provide clear onboarding guidance for new users

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User Account**: Represents student users with authentication method preferences, linked to homework assignments and classes
- **Authentication Provider**: Google, Apple, or email-based authentication, each with specific OAuth flows and token management
- **Email Template**: Professional homework app branded templates for magic links, welcome messages, and notifications
- **Performance Metrics**: Load times, bundle sizes, and user interaction response times for monitoring production quality
- **UI Component Library**: Consistent design system elements ensuring polished appearance across all interfaces
