# Feature Specification: Reliable Push Reminders (PWA)

**Feature Branch**: `010-fix-notifications-pwa`  
**Created**: 2025-09-13  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "we need to fix the notification bug, on my pwa it does not send reminders (push notifications) even though everything looks set. I don't know if this is due to the app's design, will it ever really be able to send push notifications like a real native app? if yes that is the mission"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a student, I want the app to notify me at the right time about my upcoming assignments, even when the app is closed, so I don‚Äôt miss deadlines.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given notifications are enabled and a reminder is set for an assignment, When the reminder time arrives, Then the user receives a notification on their device within an acceptable delay window.
2. Given the app is installed as a PWA and not currently open, When a reminder is due, Then a notification appears with the assignment title and tapping it opens the app to the relevant view.
3. Given Quiet Hours are enabled between a start and end time, When a reminder falls within that window, Then the reminder is suppressed or delayed according to the defined behavior.
4. Given a user presses ‚ÄúSend test notification‚Äù in Settings, When the action completes, Then a notification arrives within 60‚Äì120 seconds with the expected message.
5. Given a user has disabled notifications in the OS or browser, When a reminder is due, Then the app does not notify and guidance is shown within the app on how to re-enable.

### Edge Cases
- Device offline at send time: reminders queued and delivered later or skipped [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should reminders be retried for X minutes/hours after due time?]
- Multiple devices: ensure duplication rules [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: notify all enrolled devices, or only the most recently active device?]
- iOS PWA limitations: notifications support varies by iOS version and installation method [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: minimum iOS version/support matrix and expectation for iPad/macOS Safari].
- App uninstalled or subscription stale: gracefully stop attempting delivery and surface a re-subscribe prompt.
- Doze/low-power modes: define acceptable delay tolerance.
- Quiet Hours spanning midnight (e.g., 22:00‚Äì07:00): ensure expected behavior.
- Time zone changes and DST transitions: reminders align to local time.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Users MUST be able to enable/disable reminders and view current permissions status in-app.
- **FR-002**: Users MUST receive reminder notifications at or near the configured offset (target within ¬±2 minutes under normal conditions).
- **FR-003**: Notifications MUST arrive when the app is closed or in the background, on supported platforms.
- **FR-004**: A test notification flow MUST reliably demonstrate end‚Äëto‚Äëend delivery within 60‚Äì120 seconds when invoked from Settings.
- **FR-005**: Quiet Hours MUST suppress reminders inside the window (including across midnight) per user settings.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST clearly communicate when notifications are unavailable due to platform or permission constraints and provide actionable guidance.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST avoid duplicate notifications for the same reminder on a single device.
- **FR-008**: Tapping a notification MUST open the app to a meaningful destination (e.g., assignment detail or main view).
- **FR-009**: The system MUST maintain a valid subscription and degrade gracefully when the subscription expires or is revoked.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST document platform support expectations (Android, Desktop, iOS versions) and define behavior where push is unsupported.

*Clarifications needed:*
- **FR-011**: Delivery retry policy [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should missed reminders be sent late? If yes, define retry window and wording].
- **FR-012**: Multi‚Äëdevice behavior [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: notify all registered devices vs. primary device].
- **FR-013**: Content policy [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what content can appear in notifications (title only vs. details), privacy expectations].

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Reminder Preference**: per-user settings including enablement, default offset, Quiet Hours configuration.
- **Reminder**: a timed intent associated to an assignment with a scheduled delivery time derived from due date and offset.
- **Subscription**: a durable record that a device is enrolled to receive notifications for a given user; may expire or be revoked.
- **Delivery Attempt**: a single try to deliver a reminder with status (scheduled, sent, failed, suppressed, retried) for observability.
