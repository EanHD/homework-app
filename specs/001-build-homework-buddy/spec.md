# Feature Specification: Homework Buddy Web

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-homework-buddy`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build Homework Buddy Web (React + Vite + TypeScript). PWA installable, offline-first. Features: classes, assignments, Today/Upcoming, local notifications via Service Worker (where supported), IndexedDB via localforage. UI: Mantine or MUI, light theme, blue #1E88E5, progress ring + streak, bottom-drawer form, emoji/color for class. Deliverables: src/components/*, src/store/*, PWA setup (manifest, service worker), minimal unit tests (store)."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a student, I want to track my classes and assignments in a simple app I can install on my device, see what‚Äôs due today or upcoming, mark work complete, and get timely reminders ‚Äî even when I‚Äôm offline ‚Äî so I can stay on top of my homework.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given a fresh install with no data, When the user creates a class and adds an assignment due today, Then the assignment appears in the Today list and the progress indicator reflects 0% until marked complete.
2. Given notifications permission is granted, When an assignment‚Äôs due time arrives (or a configured reminder time), Then the user receives a local notification on supported devices; When unsupported or permission denied, Then the app does not error and offers guidance to enable notifications.
3. Given the device is offline, When the user opens the app, Then previously created classes and assignments are available; When the user adds or completes an assignment offline, Then the change is persisted locally and remains after reload.
4. Given several incomplete assignments with future dates, When the user opens Upcoming, Then assignments are listed by due date with their class labels, and counts reflect the number of incomplete items.
5. Given the user completes at least one assignment on consecutive days, When viewing Today, Then a ‚Äústreak‚Äù indicator shows the number of consecutive days with at least one completion.

### Edge Cases
- Timezone and DST changes around midnight may affect what counts as ‚Äútoday‚Äù [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: define timezone basis (device local) and day boundary rules].
- Due times in the past: should appear as overdue until completed.
- Duplicate assignment titles allowed? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- Large data volumes (hundreds of assignments/classes) should remain usable and performant for list views.
- PWA install prompts vary by browser; app should clearly indicate install availability without blocking core use.
- Notifications scheduling offset and repeat behavior not specified [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: default reminder time before due? multiple reminders?].

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create, edit, and delete classes with a name, color, and emoji for visual identification.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to create, edit, and delete assignments with a title, due date/time, and associated class.
- **FR-003**: System MUST present a Today view listing all incomplete assignments due on the current calendar day.
- **FR-004**: System MUST present an Upcoming view listing all incomplete assignments ordered by due date/time.
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to mark assignments complete/incomplete; lists and counts update accordingly.
- **FR-006**: System MUST display a progress indicator for the day (e.g., percent of today‚Äôs assignments completed).
- **FR-007**: System MUST display a ‚Äústreak‚Äù indicating consecutive days with at least one assignment completed.
- **FR-008**: System MUST persist all data locally and function offline; app state MUST survive reload without network.
- **FR-009**: System MUST be installable as a Progressive Web App with app metadata and icons.
- **FR-010**: System SHOULD support local notifications for assignments at or before due time on platforms that allow it; when unsupported or permission is denied, it MUST degrade gracefully without errors.
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide a streamlined add-assignment experience via a bottom-sheet/drawer form that can optionally create a new class inline.
- **FR-012**: System MUST use a light visual theme with a clearly defined primary color of blue (#1E88E5).
- **FR-013**: System MUST allow users to manage notification permission requests from within the app (prompt or settings entry point).
- **FR-014**: System SHOULD allow filtering or grouping by class in Upcoming [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: required for v1?].
- **FR-015**: System SHOULD allow setting a default reminder offset before due time [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: default offset and per-assignment override?].

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Class**: Represents a course or subject the student is taking; attributes include name (human-readable), color (for UI grouping), emoji (visual label), and an identifier. Classes group assignments.
- **Assignment**: Represents a piece of work to complete; attributes include title, due date/time, completion status, and a relationship to a Class. May include optional notes [NEEDS CLARIFICATION].
- **Preferences**: Represents user-level settings like notification permission state (read-only reflection of system), chosen reminder offset, and theme selection (light only in v1).
